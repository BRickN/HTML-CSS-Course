(generate package.json file (default settings))
npm init -y 

(install sass -> will be added as a dependency on package.json)
npm i node-sass

(to use node-sass you need an npm script. In package.json you can define your scripts)
npm run ***ScriptName***
npm run sass

(npm run node-sass -w scss/ -o dist/css/ --recursive)
(watch scss/ folder, output dist/css/ folder)






scss files with a _ infront of the name are partials. They wont be compiled as a seperate css file
but will be compiled in the main.css. If you want seperate css files you need exclude the _
symbol infront of the scss filename


function vs mixin
function returns something
mixin is a set of styles you want to include
